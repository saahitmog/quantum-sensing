ZRJ Antenna fidelity and heating experiments

Goal: determine the maximum safe operating power for the 3 turn antenna

Running ODMR scans to run power through the antenna at increasing power
	1- .16V - 3scans of 10,000 avg - too long bring it down!
	2- 0.26V - 3 scans of 5000 avg - also too long probably bring down again "Time elapsed 4.26" (not sure if this is min or what)
	3 - 0.36 - 2 scans of 5000 avg 

	no obvious changes to sample holder or electrical tap thus far; checking after each run by poking with scraper tool

	4 - 0.46V - 3 scans of 2500 avg
	5 - 0.50V - 3 scans of 2500 avg
		-some gooey stuff looking like its starting to appear - i think this is residual from the liquid electrical tape that I missed in scraping
		- electrical tape may be getting soft
	6- 0.6 - """
		-tape is getting a little goey but not like, dramatically gooey; 3d printed piece is intact
	7- 0.7V - ""
		- this is now definitely melting the tape - brown discoloration appearing near where the tape begins
			-still could be from liquid electrical tape but unsure
	8 - 0.8V ""
		-same story
	- - 0.9 V 
	

Measurement on realSample
3:34 pm (Ithink)  - 153406 i think
4:06 pm  #160631 repeated measurement with more averges and MW power at 0.26 (was 0.16) - accidentaly only did 1 avg
4:13 pm - actually 10 avgs set this time, MW power to 0.3
